This is a fork from [Dupe Station](https://github.com/ProjectDupe/DupeStation), which is a fork of [Goob Station](https://github.com/Goob-Station/Goob-Station), a primary fork from [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14). To prevent people forking [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), a "content" pack is loaded by the client and server. This content pack contains everything needed to play the game on one specific server this is the content pack for Dupe Station.

Dupe Station strives to be a fork heavily focused on roleplay over gameplay while still focusing on community. We intend to take more mechanics from other forks, we wish to make a server where chaos does exist, but is moderate and allow people to still roleplay and not end the round 1 hour in because of a random Assistant/Graytider.

If you want to host or create content for SS14, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) as it contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs and is the base for your fork.

## Documentation/Wiki

The Goob Station [docs site](https://docs.goobstation.com/) has documentation on GS14's content, engine, game design, and more. It also has lots of resources for new contributors to the project; this website is great for use, and because we are so closely related to Goob Station, we suggest checking them out! They are our upstream and we pull most changes from them.
